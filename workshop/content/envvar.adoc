== Config Maps and Secrets

We will obviously need some parameters that our different application will need to work.

=== Step 1: Change project

IMPORTANT: Don't forget this step!

We can now come back to the main project that has been created for you for this: `xraylab-{GUID}`

On the Terminal window, enter this command (type it, copy/paste, or just click on it, this is the last time I'll put this notice...):

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc project xraylab-{GUID}
----

You should normally get this:
[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
Now using project "xraylab-{GUID}" on server ...
----


=== Step 2: Edit Config Maps

Provided you are still in the `files` directory in the Terminal (full path `/opt/app-root/workshop/files`), you can take a look at the config maps file:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
cat 02_config-maps.yaml
----

You can see that there are 3 config maps that will be created, and that two values must be edited, `bucket-base-name` and `url-external`.

* The first one is your choice, but I *strongly* recommend that you use the same name as your main project, `xraylab-{GUID}`. It will be easier to help you in case of problems, and it has to be *unique in the whole cluster*. +
You can edit the file `02_config-maps.yaml` with your favorite editor (vi and nano are available), or simply do:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
sed -i 's/bucket-base-name_replace_me/xraylab-{GUID}/g' 02_config-maps.yaml
----

* The second one is the external route to the RGW. It will be used to directly display images from the different buckets into our Grafana dashboard. +
This route is: `http://rgw-openshift-storage.{CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN}` +
Again, you can edit the file `02_config-maps.yaml` or simply do:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
sed -i 's/url-external_replace_me/https:\/\/rgw-openshift-storage.{CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN}/g' 02_config-maps.yaml
----

=== Step 3: Create Config Maps

Now that our file is ready, we can create the Config Maps:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 02_config-maps.yaml
----

=== Step 4: Edit the Secrets

It's the same process that we will follow, but this time for the secrets. +
Take a look at the secrets file:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
cat 03_secrets.yaml
----

The values to replace here are you S3 Access Key and Secret. Here they are again: +

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY: `{ACCESS_KEY}`
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: `{SECRET_KEY}`

You can edit the file and replace the value, or simply do:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
sed -i 's/AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_replace_me/{ACCESS_KEY}/g' 03_secrets.yaml
----

and

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
sed -i 's/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_replace_me/{SECRET_KEY}/g' 03_secrets.yaml
----

=== Step 5: Create the Secrets

Now that our file is ready, we can create the Secrets:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 03_secrets.yaml
----

=== Step 5: Verification

* Change your workspace to the Console, navigate to Projects and select `xraylab-{GUID}`.

* From the Console menu, navigate to Workloads->Config Maps and check that `buckets-config`, `database-host` and `service-point` have been created.

* Navigate to Workloads->Secrets and check that `s3-secret` and `db-secret` have been created.
