== Image Streams

These Image Streams will be used to abstract the different container images we will use from their actual source.

=== Creation

Nothing to modify here. Have a look at the file, and apply it:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 05_image-streams.yaml
----

=== Verification

From the Console menu, navigate to Builds->Image Streams and verify that `image-generator`, `image-server` and `risk-assessment` have been created.
