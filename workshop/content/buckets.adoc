== Buckets and Bucket Notifications creation

For this last preparation step, we will use a Jupyer Notebook. Remember what we have deployed in the very first module? It's time to use it!

=== Connect to JupyterHub

As ODH has been deployed in the *odh-{GUID}* project, the Route to access it will be: +

https://jupyterhub-odh-{GUID}.{CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN}/[https://jupyterhub-odh-{GUID}.{CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN}/,window=_blank]

Just click on this link, a new tab will open. Click on the button *Sign in with OpenShift*, and use your OpenTLC credentials to connect.+
On the first connection, OpenShift will ask to authorize the application to access your username just click *Allow selected permissions*.

=== Launch Jupyter

On the *Spawner Options* page select the *s2i-minimal-notebook:3.6* image from the first dropdown (this should be the default image), and click *Spawn* at the bottom.

Your Jupyter environment will take 15-20 seconds to launch.

It will display a _File Explore like_ interface. Click on the *xraylab_notebooks.git* folder, then on the *create_notifications.ipynb* file, which will launch the notebook. You can directly follow the rest of the instructions there.

You will need the following info:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY: `{ACCESS_KEY}`
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: `{SECRET_KEY}`
