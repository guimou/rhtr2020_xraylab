== Kafka Topic

This is the "channel" where our bucket notifications will be sent. We will still use the AMQ Streans operator to easily create it.

=== Creation

Still nothing to modify here. Have a look at the file, and apply it:

[source,bash,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f 07_topics.yaml
----

=== Verification

In the Console, you can navigate to Operators->Installed Operators->Red Hat Integration - AMQ streams, and select the Kafka Topic tab. `xray-images` should be listed. +
We will also see another method in the next step.
